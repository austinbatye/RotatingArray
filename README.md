# RotatingArray
The link to this exercise is at [www.hackerrank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation/problem)

1. enter the number of elements in the array
2. enter the number of cycles to rotate the array
3. enter each element of the array seperated by a space(" ")
4. the new array will be displayed.

Test cases 8 and 9 currently time out as the number of elements in the array pushes the limit of how large an integer can be.

An updated version is currently being worked on and will be pushed to Github when it is complete.
